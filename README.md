Toronto Public Library offers access to Scott's Business Directories Online, an online database of Canadian companies. 
Their website adds an extra `http://` in front of the hyperlink of a company's website, making it useless to click. This extension will remove 
the extra `http://` in front of the href so clicking the link will lead to the website successfully. 
This extension is for Chromium based browers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

**Installation**: 
1. Go to the extensions page in your browser, turn on developer mode if you haven't. 
2. Click Load unpacked, and select the folder of this code repository
